# Welcome to my professional portfolio.

Hello, my name is Alexander, I'm 22 years old and I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I'm a software developer and I graduated in IT in the ending of 2017, at the moment I'm studying data science and machine learning. In this repository I'll include a lot of notebooks about data science, since I'm a begginer, feel free to give me any advices.
